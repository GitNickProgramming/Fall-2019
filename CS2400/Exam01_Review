II. Chapter 1 - Abstraction, Technology, and Performance.
    - Great Ideas:
        1. Abstraction 
            a. Abstractions to characterize the design at different levels of representation; lower
            level details are hidden to offer a simpler model at higher levels.
        2. Make the Momoon case fast 
            a. Making the common case fast will tend to enhance performance better than optimizing the rare case.
        3. Performance via Parallelism 
            a. Computer architects have offered designs that get more performance by computing operations in parallel
        4. Performance via Pipelining
            a. A particular pattern of parallelism is so prevalent in computer architecture that
            it merits its own name: Pipelining
            b. Which moves multiple operations through hardware units that each do a piece of an operation.
        5. Performance via Prediction 
            a. The idea of predicton is that in some cases it can be faster on average to guess and start working rather
            than wait until you know for sure.
        6. Hierarchy of memories 
            a. Programmers want the memory to be fast, large, and cheap, as memory speed often shapes performance,
            capacity limits the size of problems that can be solved, and the cost of memory today is often the 
            majority of computer cost.
            b. Architects have found that they can address conflicting demands of fast, large, and cheap memory with a 
            hierarchy of memories.
        7. Dependability via Redundancy 
            a. Computers not only need to be fast; they need to be dependable.
            b. Since any physical device can fail, we make systems dependable by including redundant components that 
            can take over when failure occurs.

                + Average number of clock cycles per instruction for a program or program fragment.
            d. Instruction Count and CPI:

                Clock Cycles = Instruction Count * Cycles Per Instruction 
                CPU Time = Instruction Count * CPI * Clock Cycle Time 
                         = Instruction Count * CPI / Clock Rate 
            e. Instruction Count for a Program is determined by program, ISA and compiler

            a. If different instruction classes take different numbers of cycles 
                Clock Cycles = Summation(CPI * Instruction Count)

            b. The equation is used for CPU clock cycles based on instruction count and CPI to find
            the total number of clock cycles for each sequence:
                Global CPI = Total Clock Cycles / Total Instructions
        + Trade Off in RISC and CISC 
            a. RISC 
                1. Increased number of Instructions per program 
                2. Decreases CPI

V. Practice Questions:
    1. (Performance) 
        Cars dirve 60km/h over a 1km long bridge. A car thus requires 1 minute to cross the bridge. Cars stay 
        separated by about 100m, so 1 car enters and another exits the bridge every 6 seconds.

        The execution time is ______?
        
        
        answer: 1 min
        
        What is the throughput for the same scenario?
        
        
        answer: 10 cars
    
    2. (Performance)
        Replacing a processor in a computer with a faster processor has what effect?

        answer: Decrease in Repsonse time and Increase in throughput

    3. (Performance)
        Adding additional processor to a system that uses multiple processors for separate tasks --for example, 
        searching the web -- has what effect? Assume that before adding processors, tasks do not wait to execute
        (Tasks do not "queue up").

        answer: Increase Throughput

    4. (Performance) 
        If a computer A runs a program in 10 seconds and computer B runs the same program in 15 seconds, how 
        much faster is A than B? 

        answer: Time taken to run a program
        10s on A, and 15s on B 

        Execution Time/Execution time = 15s/10s = 1.5
        Therefore, A is 1.5 times faster than B 

    5. (Performance) 
        Computer C's Performance is 4 times as fast as the performance of computer B, which runs a given 
        application in 28 seconds. How long will computer C take to run that application? 

        answer: 
        Performance/Performance = Execution time/Execution time 
        Time is the measure of computer performance 
    
    6. (Performance) 
        A task runs alone on a CPU. The task starts by running for 5ms. The task then waits for 4ms while the
        operating system runs some instructions to access disk. The CPU is then idle for 2ms while waiting for data
        from the disk. Finally the task runs another 10 ms and completes.

        answer:
        The elapsed time = 5 + 4 + 2 + 10
                         = 21 
        Elapsed time is the total time, also know as wall clock time or response time.

        The user CPU time = 5 + 10
                          = 15 
        User CPU time is just the time that the task runs on the CPU. 

        The System CPU time = 5 + 4 + 10
                            = 19 ms 
        CPU time is the total time the CPU spends running instructions either of this taks or of the operating system of for this task.

        System performance is the elapsed time, so 5 + 4 + 2 + 10 = 21
        The CPU performance is just the user CPU time, so 5 + 10 = 25
    
    7. (Performance)
        Our Favorite Program runs in 10 seconds on computer A, Which as a 2 GHz clock. We are trying to help a computer designer build a
        computer, B, which will run this program in 6 seconds. The designer has determined that a substantial increase in the clock rate
        is possible, but this incease will affect the rest of the CPU design, causing computer B to require 1.2 times as many clock cycles 
        as computer A for this program. What clock rate should we tell the designer to target? 

        answer:
                A: 2 Ghz clock, 10s CPU time 

                Designing Computer B 
                Aim is for 6s CPU Time
                Restriction: can do faster clock, but 1.2xclock cycles

                Clock Rate = Clock Cycles/CPU time = 1.2 x Clock Cycles/ 6s
                Clock Cycles = CPU time * Clock Rate 
                             = 10s X 2 GHz = 20 * 10^9

                Clock Rate = (1.2 * 20 x 10^9)/6s
                           = (24x10^9)/6s = 4 GHz

    8. (Performance - CPI) 
        Suppose we have two implementations of the same instruction set architecture. Computer A has a clock cycle time of 250ps and 
        CPI of 2.0 for some program, and computer B has a clock cycle time of 500ps and a CPI of 1.2 for the same program. Which 
        computer is faster for this program and by how much?

        Computer A: Clock Cycle Time = 250ps, CPI = 2.0
        Computer B: Clock Cycle Time = 500ps, CPI = 1.2 

        Which Computer has a faster clock?
             Same Instruction set Architecture (ISA)
        Which is faster, and by how much?

        answer:
            CPU Time(A) = Instruction n Count * CPI(A) * Cycle Time(A) 
                        = I * 2.0 * 250ps = I * 500ps                   ---> A is faster
            CPU Time(B) = Instruction n Count * CPI(B) * Cycle Time(B)
                        = I * 1.2 * 500ps = I * 600ps 
            CPU Time(B)/CPU Time(A) = (I * 600ps)/(I * 500ps) = 1.2     ---> By this much

    9. (Performance - CPI)

        Sequence 1: IC = 5 
        Clock Cycles = 2*1 + 1*2 + 2*3 
                     = 10 
        Avg. CPI = 10/5 = 2.0

        Sequence 2: IC = 6 
        Clock Cycles = 4*1 + 1*2 + 1*3 
                     = 9 
        Avg. CPI = 9/6
                 = 1.5 
    
    10. (Performance - Review Q)
        A given application written in Java runs 15seconds on a desktop procesor. A new Java compiler.
        Unfortunately, It increased the CPI by 1.1. How fast can we expect the application to run using
        this new compiler? 

        Execution Time = Instruction Count * CPI * Clock Cycle 

        Solving for both compilers we get:
            Execution time of C1 / Execution time of C2 
        
        Answer: Execution time of C2 = 15 * .6 * 1.1 
    
    11. (Performance)
        Consider two different processors P1 and P2 executing the same instruction set. P1 has a 4 GHz clock 
        rate and a CPI of 1. P2 has a 3 GHz Clock Rate and a CPI of 1.5. Which processor has the highest performance 
        Expressed in instructions per second?

    12. (Performance)
        Consider three different processors P1, P2, and P3, executing the same instruction set. P1 has 3GHz clock rate and a CPI of 1.5.
        P2 has a 2.5 GHz clock rate and a CPI of 1.0. P3 has a 4.0 GHz clock rate and has a CPI of 2.2.

        Which Processor has the highest performance expressed in instructions per second?
        If the Processors each execute a program in 10 seconds, find the number of cycles and the number of instructions.

        Answer:
            3Ghz / 1.5 = 2x10^9
            2.5GHz / 1.0 = 2.5x10^9
            4GHz / 2.2 = 1.82x10^9
            Therefore, P2 has the higest performance among the three 

            Cycles:
            P1: 3GHz * 10 = 3x10^10 cycles 
            P2: 2.5GHz * 10 = 2.5x10^10 cycles 
            P3: 4GHz * 10 = 4 * 10^10 cycles 

            Number of Instructions:
            P1: 3GHz * 10 / 1.5 = 2x10^10 instructions 
            P2: 2.5GHz * 10 / 1.0 = 2.5x10^10 instrcutions
            P3: 4GHz * 10 / 2.2 = 1.82x10^10 instructions

    13. (Performance)

        Power = k x voltage^2 x Frequency switched 

            k = 3 / (16x10^9)

        new Power = k x (4)^2 x (6 x 10^9)

    14. (Performance)
        Suppose we developed a new, simpler processor that has 85% of the capacitive load of the more complex older
        processor. Further, assume that it can adjust voltage so that it can reduce voltage 15% compared to processor B,
        which results in a 15% shrink in frequency. What is the impact on dynamic power?

        P = (1/2) * Capacitive load x voltage^2 x Frequency switched 

        Compare by: Power(new) / Power(old)

    15. (Performance)
        A Program runs in 100 seconds. Multiply operations are responsible for 30 of those seconds. If extensive designer
        effort is applied such that multiply operations are made to run 2 times faster, what is the program's new execution time?

        Execution time after improvement = (Execution time affected by improvement/Amount of improvement) + execution time unaffected 
                                         = 30 / 2 + 70 = 85 sec

    16. (Performance)
        Suppose a program runs in 100 seconds on a computer, with multiply operations responsible for 80 seconds of this time.
        How much do I have to improve the speed of multiplication if I want my program to run five times faster? 

        100/5 = 80/? + 20

    17. (MIPS)
        Consider the following performance measurements for a program:
            Measurement             Computer A      Computer B 
            Instruction Count       10 billion      8 Billion 
            Clock Rate              4 GHz           4 GHz 
            CPI                     1.0             1.1 

        Which computer has the higher MIPS rating?
        Which computer is faster for that program?

        4x10^9 / 1.0x10^6 = 4000
        4x10^9 / 1.1x10^6 = 3636 

        answer:
            Computer A executes more than a million instructions per second, so computer A has a higher MIPS rating than computer B. 

            CPU time = instr count * CPI * Clock cycle time 
                     = 10 * 10^9 instr * (1.0 cycles / ir.str) * (1/4x10^9 sec)
                     = 2.5 sec 
            CPU time = 8x10^9 instr * (1.1 cycles / ir.str) * (1/4x10^9 sec)
                     = 2.2 sec 
            
            Even though computer A has a higher MIPS rating, computer B is actually faster. Thus, using just MIPs rating 
            (or any other subset of factors) to compare performance can be misleading.
